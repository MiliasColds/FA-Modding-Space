-- Other ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved all sorts of other little things including the graphics effects and sound effects of units, their target
 priorities, responsiveness to commands, unit threat ratings, and the AI of some units.

Modified the cost and build times of most units to have more even build cost rates in accordance to the increase in
 the T3 factory build rates. All cost changes have a relatively negligable effect on cost value of units.

This mod includes all of the useful bug fixes from the Community Bug Fix Patch V3 mod and even fixes the bugs with
 the bug fix patch. If you have the community bug fix patch, use this instead and not both.

If you have a desire to know the full width of the changes in this mod, learn to read the code.

-- For the Future ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I plan to add some new icons to represent armored assault bots, sniper bots, the shield disruptor, and some other
units. If anybody has any good ideas, i am open to suggestions. If i can, i will also change the description on some
units to better match their actual role.

  If you have complaints or suggestions you know where to reach me, and if you dont, ask somebody who does, if you
dont know one of them make friends until you find one who does.
